# Monte Carlo options pricer
Implementation of Monte Carlo options pricer in Python.

I have implemented a european call and lookback call. Each inherits from a Derivative parent class, which has a function called Price() you can call to run the Monte Carlo simulation.

# Usage
1) clone repo using 'git clone https://github.com/benWindsorCode/monteCarloOptionPricing.git'
2) run pricer/main.py
